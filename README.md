  <h1>Social Network Analysis using Graph Neural Network</h1>
  <p>
    This project implements social network analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). 
    It leverages graph-based machine learning techniques to extract insights and patterns 
    from social network data. The main objective is to explore relationships and influence 
    patterns in networked data using GNN models.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Run</h2>
  <p>To run the project, simply execute:</p>
  <pre><code>python Main.py</code></pre>

  <h2>What this Project Does</h2>
  <p>This project analyzes social network data using Graph Neural Networks to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Model complex relationships between entities in a social network</li>
    <li>Identify influential nodes and communities</li>
    <li>Predict node properties and missing connections</li>
    <li>Visualize network structures and patterns</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The implementation includes data preprocessing, graph construction, GNN model training, 
    and result visualization components.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Result</h2>
  <p>The analysis produces:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Network visualizations showing community structures</li>
    <li>Node classification and link prediction results</li>
    <li>Influence metrics for important nodes in the network</li>
    <li>Comparative analysis of different GNN architectures</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates the power of Graph Neural Networks for social network analysis, 
    providing insights into relationship patterns and influence propagation that would be 
    difficult to obtain with traditional methods. The implementation serves as a foundation 
    for more advanced network analysis applications.
