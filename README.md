  <h1>Social Network Analysis using Graph Neural Network</h1>
  <p>
This project implements social network analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). 
It leverages graph-based machine learning techniques to extract insights and patterns 
from social network data. The main objective is to explore relationships and influence 
patterns in networked data using GNN models. By representing social networks as graphs, 
the project captures both the structure and the attributes of entities, allowing 
for advanced analysis such as community detection, influence propagation, and 
prediction of unseen connections. Additionally, this project demonstrates how 
GNNs can outperform traditional network analysis methods by learning complex patterns 
directly from the data, making it suitable for applications in recommendation systems, 
social influence modeling, and targeted marketing strategies. With end-to-end 
implementation from data preprocessing to visualization, this project provides 
a robust framework for exploring the hidden dynamics of social networks.
